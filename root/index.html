        <h1>General curiosity</h1>
        <p>
            I have many interests. Computer science, System Design, Frontend development, Mobile development, Cloud development, Online marketing, Health Care Software, Computational Finance, Machine Learning, Auth and multi-tenant systems, containers.
            I decided to satisfy this curiosity by dedicating a small amount of my evenings to slowly become and expert in those fields.
            I feel that up till now I had the unique opportunity to spend substential time in each of this subject but I cannot call myself an expert in any of them.
            By trying to explain many little concepts over a long period of time in each of those subjects, I am hoping that I will feel competent in each of them.
